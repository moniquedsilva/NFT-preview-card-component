## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor 

### What I learned

Still in the process of learning Vue, this project gave me a good understanding of Vue structure. It was also my first time using SASS in a project and I really liked it, I'll use it more often.
...and learned how to use pseudo-elements to smooth hover transitions.

### Useful resources

- [Vue Sass Tutorial Tricks](https://youtu.be/agaC4oKn_0k) - Not much for the video, but the comments section helps me fix an error with Vue/Sass that I wasn't able to resolve.
- [Learn Sass In 20 Minutes](https://youtu.be/Zz6eOVaaelI) - In fact it helped me learn all the sass I needed.
